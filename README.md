# ALTA 2024 Demo

This project demonstrates a logistic regression model for classifying sentences as either generated by a machine or a human. The model is trained using TF-IDF vectorization and logistic regression, and it predicts labels for the sentences in the test set.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Ensure that you have Python installed on your system. It is recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

### Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo.git
   cd your-repo
   ```
2. **Create and Activate a Virtual Environment** (Optional but recommended):
```
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
```

3. **Install Required Packages:**
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Usage

To train the model and predict labels for the test set, use the following command:
```
python logistic_regression_machine_text.py --train_file data/train.json --test_file data/phase1_test_without_labels.json --output_file data/answer.json
```
- **`--train_file`**: Path to the training data file (in JSON format).
- **`--test_file`**: Path to the test data file (in JSON format).
- **`--output_file`**: (Optional) Path to the output file for predictions. Default is `data/answer.json`.
